## CRUD ON JAVASCRIPT BY TERMINAL.

In this project were created five functions to do a CRUD correctly. 
- The first function was made to show the whole database using a method GET. 
- The second function is related with method POST to create a new product, however, this function uses another function (third function) to validate if the data that you are trying to add is okay according to the format specified. 
 - The next function was made to update products that are already registered on database.
 - The final function is to delete products by its 'id'.

This project is divided in two folders, the firs one contains database (db.json) and all the files related with Json-server to simulate an production environment. The next folder contains the logic on JavaScript that allows to do a CRUD correctly.
